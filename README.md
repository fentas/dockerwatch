## Getting started

A regular user may be able to fetch fswatch from the package manager of your OS or a third-party one. If you are looking for fswatch for OS X, you can install it using either MacPorts or Homebrew:
```sh
# MacPorts
$ port install fswatch
$ port install jq

# Homebrew
$ brew install fswatch
$ brew install jq
```
Check your favourite package manager and let us know if fswatch is missing there.

## Install dockerwatch
